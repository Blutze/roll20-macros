# Blutze's Collection of Roll20 Macros

A variety of things to keep in mind:
- The majority of these macros was written for a specific group of characters. Ranger spells will, until we start a new campaign with an actual ranger, only show up if they are not on the druid list - because they are accessed through a level of prestige ranger on a druid.
- This will always be a work in progress. As of May 2021, the characters are still being played and learning new spell levels etc, and I probably won't be making macros multiple levels ahead of our progress.
- Some spell macros include my own interpretations and rulings, especially in the name of shortening the descriptions. More importantly, the attack macros are influenced by certain houserules (specifically, TWF with a light offhand is +0/+0, and weapon finesse is a default effect for everybody).
